The files in this folder are the reasonable minimum 
set of files needed to compile bare metal C applications
for the STM32F401xE Microcontrollers. Most of them have
been taken from example projects provided by ST, some of 
them have been written from scratch for this purpose.


Files provided by ARM Ltd.
==========================
arm_common_tables.h
arm_const_structs.h
arm_math.h
core_cm4.h
core_cm4_simd.h
core_cmFunc.h
core_cmInstr.h

These files are part of every Cortex-M4 project, they contain
all needed declarations and definitions to interact with the
ARM-core, they are the same for all manufacturers.


Files provided by STMicroelectronics
====================================
stm32f401xe.h
stm32f4xx.h

These are device specific and contain all declarations and
definitions needed to access the peripherals in this particular
device, most of it are structures and addresses of all peripheral 
device registers mentioned in the reference manual.


Files written from scratch
==========================
gcc_linker.ld
gcc_startup_system.c

These files are provided by the author of this example project.
They have been written from scratch to provide the smallest
possible (or reasonable) staring point.

The linker script (*.ld) defines the memory layout and where to 
place the various sections produced by the linker. It is very
minimal and defines only the sections needed for bare metal C
but can later be expanded or replaced by something more elaborate

The startup_system file contains the vector table, the startup 
code and all needed initialization that is executed before finally 
entering main(). This part is often split into separate files, 
partially written in assembly, but in this example everything is 
implemented in C and has been put into one file for simplicity.
